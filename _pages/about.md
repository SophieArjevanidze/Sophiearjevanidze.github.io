The Policy Data Center serves as a platform to share our work, showcase data-driven projects, and foster collaboration around building more transparent, efficient, and evidence-based policy systems.
Our mission is to bridge the gap between complex datasets and actionable insights that can empower better decision-making in the public sector. 
We support developing countries in harnessing data to inform policy, while embracing the transformative potential of digital technologies for inclusive, accountable governance.
