Sophie Arjevanidze
As the founder of the Policy Data Center, I am driven by a passion for harnessing data to inform public policy and accelerate digital transformation. With a background in research and analytics, my mission is to bridge the gap between complex datasets and actionable insights that can shape better decisions in the public sector. This platform is a space to share our work, showcase data-driven projects, and collaborate on building more transparent, efficient, and evidence-based policy systems.
